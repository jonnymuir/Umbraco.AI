/**
 * Regression coverage for the contract the Copilot Workspace reopen-race fix depends on:
 * `loadInitial()` must call the caller's `getAgentNames` closure LAZILY, at the moment it actually runs
 * (see its ctor doc) — not capture its result once, earlier. That laziness is what lets
 * `UaiCopilotWorkspaceChatContext#syncTarget` close the real race (the view fires `loadAgents()`
 * without awaiting it, so the agent catalog and the conversation history load concurrently) simply by
 * `await`ing the catalog's load before calling `loadInitialMessages()` — if this strategy instead read
 * `getAgentNames()` once up front (e.g. at construction), awaiting anything in the caller afterwards
 * wouldn't help, since the closure's answer would already be frozen from before the catalog populated.
 *
 * NOTE: `UaiCopilotWorkspaceChatContext` itself can't be constructed under this package's vitest setup
 * today (`UaiWorkspaceAgentRepository`'s real constructor needs `UaiAgentRepository` from
 * `@umbraco-ai/agent`, which that package's `index.ts` barrel doesn't export — a pre-existing
 * resolution gap, unrelated to this fix, that blocks building any test host for that class). This spec
 * is the closest coverage reachable without changing shared test infra; the `#syncTarget` sequencing
 * itself was verified by code trace (see `copilot-workspace-chat.context.ts`).
