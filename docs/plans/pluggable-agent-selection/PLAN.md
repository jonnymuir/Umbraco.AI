# Plan

Task checklist for `umb-build-loop`. Work lands on `v18/dev` (via a worktree branched from it).
v17 backport and the Umbraco.Docs page are follow-ups after merge, not tasks here (see bottom).

Backend lives in `Umbraco.AI.Agent/src/Umbraco.AI.Agent.Core` (new folder
`Agents/Selection/` unless noted) and `Umbraco.AI.Agent.Web`. Specs live in
`Umbraco.AI.Agent/tests/Umbraco.AI.Agent.Tests.Unit`.

- [x] **T1** - story: S1, S2. Add the selection types in `Agents/Selection/`: `IAIAgentSelector`,
  `AIAgentSelectionRequest`, `AIAgentSelectionResult`, `AIAgentSelectionInput`,
  `AIAgentSelectorCollection`, `AIAgentSelectorCollectionBuilder` (ordered), and
  `builder.AIAgentSelectors()` in a new `Configuration/UmbracoBuilderExtensions.Selectors.cs`
  (same shape as `UmbracoBuilderExtensions.Surfaces.cs`). Register the empty collection in the
  agent composer setup. Types only, no behaviour.
  depends-on: none. parallel-group: A

- [x] **T2** - story: S5 (AC3-AC5), frontend. In `Umbraco.AI.Agent.UI` `run.controller.ts`: when
  the agent is `auto` and `resolvedAgent$` has a value, send `forwardedProps.previousAgentId`. Store
  `selectorId`/`reason` from `agent_selected`. `resetConversation()` clears the pick, and
  `abortRun()` **keeps** it (resolves the ARCHITECTURE.md TODO). In `uai-agent-client.ts`, merge
  `previousAgentId` into `forwardedProps` next to `resume`. Confirm `uai-http-agent.ts` strips only
  `resume`. Widen the `resolvedAgent$` type in `chat/context.ts` with optional
  `selectorId`/`reason`. Acceptance: `npm run build:agent` and `npm run build:agent-ui` are green.
  Behaviour is proven in T12.
  depends-on: none. parallel-group: A

- [x] **T3** - story: S4. Add `AIAgentSelectedNotification` (`StatefulNotification`, not
  cancelable) in `Agents/` next to `AIAgentExecutedNotification`, with `Selection`, `Request` and
  `Messages`. The XML docs must say "selected does not mean ran". Type only, not published yet.
  depends-on: T1. parallel-group: B

- [x] **T4** - story: S1 (AC5, AC6, AC16, AC17). Add `LLMAgentSelector` (`SelectorId = "llm"`).
  Move `BuildClassificationPrompt` and `ParseAgentIdFromResponse` out of `AIAgentService`
  unchanged. Same classifier profile and same prompt, using only the last user message text.
  Return `null` (never the first agent) on no profile, an unparseable reply, or a non-candidate
  GUID.
  depends-on: T1. parallel-group: B

- [x] **T5** - story: S5 (AC2, AC8). Add `StickyAgentSelector` (`SelectorId = "sticky"`). It
  returns `PreviousAgent` or `null`. Do **not** register it.
  depends-on: T1. parallel-group: B

- [x] **T6** - story: S3 (AC4, AC5, AC7, AC8). Add `AIAgentExecutionOptions.Selection`
  (`AIAgentSelectionResult?`). In `AIAgentService.StreamAgentAGUIAsync` (options overload),
  when `Selection` is set, add `Umbraco.AI.Agent.SelectorId` (and `SelectionReason` when not null)
  to the run's additional properties and its `LogKeys` array, alongside `RunId`/`ThreadId`. Add
  the two context-key constants to `Constants.ContextKeys`.
  depends-on: T1. parallel-group: B

- [x] **T7** - story: S1 (AC1-AC4, AC7, AC8, AC11-AC15), S2 (all), S5 (AC1, AC6). Add
  `IAIAgentSelectionService` + internal `AIAgentSelectionService`: surface lookup, active + scope
  filter (moved from `SelectAgentForPromptAsync`), 0 -> null, 1 -> `only-candidate`, user groups
  resolved once, `PreviousAgent` resolved against the candidates, the selector chain (null ->
  next; non-candidate -> warn and skip; throw -> log and skip; cancellation propagates), and
  `fallback`. No notification yet.
  depends-on: T1. parallel-group: B

- [x] **T8** - story: S4 (AC1-AC6). Publish `AIAgentSelectedNotification` from
  `AIAgentSelectionService` via `IEventAggregator.PublishAsync`, for every non-null outcome, with
  the same `AIAgentSelectionRequest` the selectors saw. Build a request for `only-candidate` too.
  depends-on: T3, T7. parallel-group: C

- [x] **T9** - story: S1 (AC9, AC10), S5 (AC9). Registration and compatibility: append
  `LLMAgentSelector` to the default collection (`IAIAgentSelectionService` is already registered by T7), and make
  `AIAgentService.SelectAgentForPromptAsync` build an input and proxy to the new service, marked
  `[Obsolete("Use IAIAgentSelectionService.SelectAgentAsync. Will be removed in v20")]`. Remove the
  now-dead classifier code from `AIAgentService`.
  depends-on: T4, T7. parallel-group: C

- [x] **T10** - story: S1 (AC18-AC20), S3 (AC1-AC3, AC6, AC9), S4 (AC7), S5 (AC7, AC10). In
  `StreamAgentAGUIController`, the `auto` branch calls `IAIAgentSelectionService` with
  `previousAgentId` read from `forwardedProps` (bad or missing values become null, never an
  error). It calls the options overload with `new AIAgentExecutionOptions { Selection = result }`,
  and adds `selectorId` and `reason` to the `agent_selected` event. The 400 and 404 responses
  stay word-for-word. The explicit-agent branch is untouched. Extend
  `StreamAgentAGUIControllerScopeTests` or add a sibling test class.
  depends-on: T6, T8, T9. parallel-group: D

- [x] **T11** - **wire: backend selection into the demo site.** Add a throwaway `TEMP_` selector
  plus composer in `demos/v18/Umbraco.AI.DemoSite/` (gitignored), with two or more Copilot agents.
  Through a real `auto` request: (a) the custom selector's agent runs; (b) the `agent_selected`
  event carries its `selectorId`/`reason`; (c) the agent run's audit log entry has the
  `SelectorId`/`SelectionReason` metadata; (d) a `TEMP_` notification handler logs one
  `AIAgentSelectedNotification`; (e) with the TEMP selector removed, the LLM selector still picks
  (or `fallback` shows when no classifier profile exists); (f) the resolved
  `AIAgentSelectorCollection` holds `LLMAgentSelector` and not `StickyAgentSelector` (S5 AC9). (f)
  is checked here because the unit project can't run the full composer (no TypeLoader outside a
  CMS host).
  depends-on: T10. parallel-group: E

- [x] **T12** - **wire: sticky selection end to end in Copilot.** With `StickyAgentSelector`
  registered by a `TEMP_` composer in the demo site, verify in the browser (network panel):
  S5 AC3 (2nd turn sends `previousAgentId` and keeps agent A, `selectorId: "sticky"`), AC4 (a new
  conversation sends none), AC5 (a tool-approval resume still carries the `resume` entries), and
  that after cancelling a run the next turn still sends `previousAgentId`.
  depends-on: T2, T11. parallel-group: F

## Copilot Workspace (added after `v18/dev` gained Workspace)

- [x] **T13** - maintenance. Merge `origin/v18/dev` into this branch (a merge, not a rebase, because
  the branch is pushed). Resolve conflicts the way the v17 backport did: keep `v18/dev` behaviour and
  layer the feature on top, for example `run.controller.ts` strategy wrapper, `AIAgentService`
  `AdditionalProperties` overlay, `Constants`, and the 8-arg streaming-service test mocks. Acceptance:
  every build (Agent, Automate, Workspace, npm agent/agent-ui/copilot/copilot-workspace) is green,
  and every test (Agent, Workspace, Automate) passes.
  depends-on: T12. parallel-group: G

- [x] **T14** - story: S8 (AC1, AC2). Add nullable `AgentId` (`Guid?`) to `AIMessage`/`AIMessageEntity`,
  with EF mapping, SQLite + SQL Server migrations (existing Workspace migration naming), repository
  mapping both ways. `ConversationChatHistoryProvider` stamps assistant messages with the runtime
  context's `Constants.ContextKeys.AgentId`, and leaves other roles null. Add a repo + service query
  for "agent ID of the newest assistant message in a conversation" (async naming per CLAUDE.md).
  depends-on: T13. parallel-group: H

- [x] **T15** - story: S7 (all). Workspace `StreamConversationAGUIController` auto path calls
  `IAIAgentSelectionService` (input per SPEC "Copilot Workspace" 2-3), sets `Selection` on the run
  options, prepends `agent_selected`, and keeps the 404 text. It no longer calls the obsolete method.
  Explicit path unchanged. Constructor change follows the repo's obsolete-ctor rule if the ctor is
  public. New controller test class.
  depends-on: T14. parallel-group: I

- [x] **T16** - story: S8 (AC3-AC5). The Workspace messages response model gains `agentId`. Regenerate
  the Workspace OpenAPI client (demo site running). The message mapper sets `agentName` from the
  Workspace agent list. Unknown or null IDs show no name.
  depends-on: T14. parallel-group: I

- [x] **T17** - **wire: Workspace on the demo site.** In a Workspace conversation set to Auto, with
  the `TEMP_` sticky composer, check:
  - Turn 1 sends `agent_selected` and shows the agent name live.
  - The assistant row in the DB has `AgentId`.
  - Turn 2's selection gets the previous pick and sticky keeps the agent.
  - The audit row has the `SelectorId` metadata.
  - Reopening the chat shows agent names on each reply.
  - An explicit-agent conversation is unchanged.
  depends-on: T15, T16. parallel-group: J

## Follow-ups (after merge, not `umb-build-loop` tasks)

- **Pickers can't see persisted history in Workspace.** Selectors only get this turn's messages there.
  Give them the conversation history (decide how much, and the cost). This needs its own design.

- **v17 backport** through the `backport` skill, as a draft PR into `v17/dev`.
- **S6 docs:** an Umbraco.Docs "Extending > Agent selection" page for v17 and v18 (selectors,
  sticky opt-in, the notification, audit metadata keys).
